### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

   One of the Labs I personally enjoyed was Lab 6 Part 1. The reason I enjoyed it so much was because it was actually pretty simple and I was able to get it done during the given class time. 

* Lab 3

    Another Lab I really enjoyed was Lab 3 Part 2. This Lab was where I first started to understand coding a little more. Part 2 was quite a task so it was good that this is where I started to understand things. 

* Lab 8

    The final Lab I enjoyed was Lab 8 Part 2. I really enjoyed this Lab because I was able to complete the lab mostly by myself. I was really proud of that fact and it really made me better at understanding the fundamentals a lot more.
